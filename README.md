# Beng-Beng

This is a basic first-person shooter game created for my Application Development class (BSCS3) using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/).

## Description

The game allows players to move around a 3D environment, aim, and shoot enemies. A start screen lets the player choose how many enemies to spawn. Enemies are placed in a maze-like scene with textured walls and lighting effects. When the player eliminates all enemies, a game over screen displays the time and kill count.

## Technologies Used

- Three.js
- JavaScript (ES Modules)
- HTML5 & CSS3
